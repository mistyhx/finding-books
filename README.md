## Concept

Surrounded by social media, now a days young people tend to read much less classics and forget how to correctly write Chinese characters.
In order to help people recall the traditions and spread the knowledge of classic literature. I decided to develop a mini web app for the
QIXI festival- the traditional Chinese valentine's day.

I initialized this idea of helping the couple Niulang and Zhinv to meet and travel with Niulang from the ground up to the sky while
answering ancient poetry style chinese riddles and enjoy the beautiful view. Then, I invited 2 writers and 1 artist to the
project.
